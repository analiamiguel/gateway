<h3>Our factoring and purchase order funding  programs</h3>
<p>When you work with Gateway Commercial Finance, you will  partner with a factoring provider who offers a diverse set of products with  flexible terms, so you cast a wide net as you prospect for new clients. In all  of our products, we focus on the end customer’s ability to pay the invoice.  That focus allows us to provide funding to a broad base of businesses.</p>
<h3>Factoring solutions</h3>
<p>We offer factoring lines that start at $25,000 per month and  go all the way up to $2 Million per month. For clients who require more than $2  Million per month, we can leverage our syndicate capabilities to offer greater funding.</p>
<p>We can generally fund between 75 and 90 percent of an  invoice, and sometimes more depending on the specific situation. We pride  ourselves on keeping the cost of funds as low as possible. In some instances,  we can offer a one percent rate on the first 30 days.</p>
<p>Our factoring solutions are available for spot purchase,  selective service, or full service. Spot purchase is a great solution for  businesses who only occasionally need funding for specific invoices. Selective  Services is an option in which the business can select to fund invoices from  specific customers. Selective service is a flexible option for businesses who  have changing cash flow needs.</p>
<p>Finally, full service provides maximum availability against  all invoices, along with full monitoring and credit support. Full service is an  ideal solution for a business that generates a large number of invoices or who  has a large customer base.</p>
