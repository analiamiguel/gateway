Spot purchase is a great solution for businesses who only occasionally need funding for specific invoices. Selective Services is an option in which the business can select to fund invoices from specific customers. Selective service is a flexible option for businesses who have changing cash flow needs.</p> <p>Finally, full service provides maximum availability against all invoices, along with full monitoring and credit support.
